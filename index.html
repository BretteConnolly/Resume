    <p>A former fashion copywriter and merchandiser, I was inspired to work in tech after 
        the pricing function of my job became automated by machine learning. I am passionate 
        about making the most of the unfathomable quantity of data we have to measure and 
        address inequity and to create products that make people's lives better.
